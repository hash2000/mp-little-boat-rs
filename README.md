# Little Boat Application

## Goals

I wanted to learn programming language Rust.
I chose Rust becose it's an interesting memory management idea.
In addition, cross-platform, excution speed. and the compiler make sure that I don't make mistakes!!
It seems to me thet a good way to learn a programming language is to teach it in practice.

In this application, I'm going to implement messaging using WebRTC tehnology. I'll study WebRTC technology at the same time.
